These test codes are unit tests rather than system integration tests because they focus on testing the rendering behavior of individual components in isolation. They use the renderer.create method to render the components and then compare the resulting JSON representation (tree) with a snapshot using expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot(). Unit tests typically verify the correctness of small, independent units of code, while system integration tests involve testing the interaction and integration of multiple components or systems.

The provided test code is classified as unit tests rather than system integration tests for several reasons.

Firstly, the tests focus on individual components, namely CustomButton, CustomTextInput, and MyCustomButton. Each test case only renders and verifies the correctness of a single component, isolated from the rest of the application.

Secondly, the tests use the renderer.create method to create a virtual representation of the component and generate a JSON snapshot of its rendered output. This approach is typical for unit tests, where the goal is to verify the behavior and rendering of a component in isolation, without considering its interaction with other components or systems.

Furthermore, the tests do not involve any complex interactions or dependencies with other components, services, or external systems. They only focus on verifying the rendering of the components and comparing it to a pre-established snapshot.

Overall, these characteristics indicate that the provided test code is suitable for unit testing, as it concentrates on testing individual components in isolation, their rendering behavior, and ensuring their correctness independent of the broader system integration context.
